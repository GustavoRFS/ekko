# Ultimate Bravery Client

The idea here is to make a custom client for League, for creating custom games, with custom rules.

This "custom client" controls the League Client via [LCU API](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcu.html), with help of [Needlework.net](https://github.com/BlossomiShymae/Needlework.Net).

Using [Wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails) (GO backend + JS/TS frontend)
